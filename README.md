# AI Fortnite Tracker

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Here is my Fortnite Tracker which allows me to recover the data of the players I lost against in order to understand their strengths.   

## Description  

I really enjoy playing Fortnite but unfortunately I'm still a mid-tier player. I can't progress and I always come across players who seem much better than me. The idea of ​​this project is to recover the data of these players in order to analyze it and draw conclusions.
